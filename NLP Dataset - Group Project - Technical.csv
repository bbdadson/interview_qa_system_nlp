"What are some differences you would expect in a model that minimizes squared error, versus a model that minimizes absolute error?","Minimizing squared error is more sensitive to outliers as it squares the errors, leading to higher penalty on larger errors. Minimizing absolute error is less sensitive to outliers but can be harder to optimize as it's not differentiable at zero."
What error metric would you use to evaluate how good a binary classifier is?,"Common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix. The choice depends on the specific context and whether false positives or false negatives have a greater cost."
"Given training data on tweets and their retweets, how would you predict the number of retweets of a given tweet after 7 days after only observing 2 days worth of data?","Use a time series forecasting model like ARIMA or LSTM, incorporating features from the initial 2-day data, possibly with external factors like user engagement metrics, to predict the 7-day retweet count."
"In an A/B test, how can you check if assignment to the various buckets was truly random?",Perform checks like comparing demographic and behavioral metrics across groups pre-test. Statistical tests can be used to confirm no significant differences exist between groups before the test.
"What might be the benefits of running an A/A test, where you have two buckets who are exposed to the exact same product?",It helps validate that the testing environment is fair and that any differences in metrics are due to random chance rather than systematic bias.

What’s the interpretation of the bias term in linear models?,"The bias term represents the intercept of the regression line, indicating the value of the output when all predictors are zero. It accounts for the mean value of the response when all predictors are at their means."
How do we interpret weights in linear models?,Weights (coefficients) represent the strength and direction of the relationship between each predictor variable and the response variable. A higher absolute weight indicates a stronger effect.

Why do we need randomization in random forest?,"Randomization in random forests (random selection of features and bootstrap samples) ensures diversity among the trees, reducing the risk of overfitting and improving model robustness."
How do we select the depth of the trees in random forest?,The depth can be chosen based on cross-validation to balance model complexity and overfitting. It may also be set based on domain knowledge or computational limitations.
How do we know how many trees we need in random forest?,The number of trees is often chosen through cross-validation: enough trees to stabilize the prediction accuracy without overfitting. More trees generally lead to better performance but at the cost of increased computation.
What happens when we have correlated features in our data?,"Correlated features can make the model harder to interpret and might lead to overfitting. It can also impact the importance of features, as the model may arbitrarily prefer one feature over another."
What’s the difference between random forest and gradient boosting?,"Random forests build trees independently and combine their predictions, while gradient boosting builds trees sequentially, each tree trying to correct errors of the previous one."

Why does XGBoost perform better than SVM?,"XGBoost often performs better due to its ability to handle a variety of data types, missing data, and numerous features. It also incorporates regularization to avoid overfitting, and its ensemble approach often yields better results than SVM's margin-based approach."
What is the default method for splitting in decision trees?,"The default method is typically a measure of impurity reduction, like Gini impurity or information gain for classification, and variance reduction for regression."

How does max pooling work? Are there other pooling techniques?,Max pooling reduces the input's dimensions by taking the maximum value over the window defined by the pool size. Other techniques include average pooling and L2-norm pooling.
Why do we actually need convolutions? Can’t we use fully-connected layers for that?,"Convolutions preserve the spatial relationship between pixels, making them well-suited for tasks like image recognition. Fully-connected layers do not preserve spatial relationships and would lead to a significantly higher number of parameters."
